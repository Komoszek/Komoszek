- Hi! My name is Łukasz, but I'm mostly known as @Komoszek or Komo. 
- My most notable achivement is getting 3rd place at [The 2017 European CanSat competition](https://www.esa.int/Education/CanSat/The_2017_European_CanSat_Competition_winners_are) as a member of CANpernicus team, where I was in charge of developing ground station software for real-time data collection and analysis. It was written in Javascript using Electron.
- AFOL, Steam Controller and ketchup enjoyer.
