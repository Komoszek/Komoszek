- Hi!. My name is Łukasz, but I'm mostly known as @Komoszek or Komo. I'm third year CS student at MINI faculty at Warsaw University of Technology.
- I'm currently working on online multiplayer game service called [kompot](https://github.com/Komoszek/kompot), which is a spiritual successor to [setGameServer](https://github.com/Komoszek/setGameServer) that I worked on in highschool, but never finished :(.
- My most notable achivement is getting 3rd place at [The 2017 European CanSat competition](https://www.esa.int/Education/CanSat/The_2017_European_CanSat_Competition_winners_are) as a member of CANpernicus team, where I was in charge of developing ground station software for real-time data collection and analysis. It was written in Javascript using Electron.
- I would describe myself as an AFOL, Steam Controller and ketchup enjoyer.
- I do my everyday work on Linux.
